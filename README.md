# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 TiwanaConnect

**TiwanaConnect** is a long-term, production-scale full-stack platform designed to digitally preserve and connect the extended Tiwana family. This is not a hobby project — it's a carefully architected system that prioritizes scalability, data integrity, security, and meaningful user experience for generations to come.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

As families grow and spread out across cities and countries, staying connected becomes harder. TiwanaConnect addresses this by offering a private digital space where every member of our biradri can:

- Understand their place in the family tree
- Explore generational connections
- Preserve our shared legacy for future generations

---

## 🧱 System Design Philosophy

TiwanaConnect is being built with the same care, planning, and engineering quality as any high-traffic SaaS application. Key architectural principles include:

- **Modular Monorepo:** Clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, docs, and infrastructure.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Future-ready for Kafka-based microservices.
- **Graph-Optimized Data:** Using Neo4j to represent complex family relationships and traversals.
- **Scalable Cloud Deployment:** Infrastructure is containerized and deployable on platforms like Railway or Fly.io, with future support for AWS/GCP.
- **Security & Privacy First:** All data is invite-only, encrypted at rest and in transit.

---

## 🚀 Current Scope (Release 1)

The **first public release** is a complete and polished experience — no partial MVPs.

### 🔹 Core Features:
- **Family Tree UI:** Visually render multi-generational family structures
- **Member Profiles:** Each person has a dedicated card with name, relationships, bio, and more
- **Admin Panel:** Internal tools for authorized management of family data
- **Secure Invite-Only Access:** No public signups; users get access via private invites only

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights

- **Clean Codebase:** Follows strict typing, linting, and formatting rules
- **Proper Git Flow:** Feature branches, PR reviews, version tagging
- **Fully Containerized:** Dev, staging, and production parity via Docker
- **Documentation-First Approach:** All architecture, design decisions, and domain logic are documented from day one
- **Gradual Versioning:** Future updates will use versioned Docusaurus and schema migrations

## 🔐 Data Privacy

TiwanaConnect respects family privacy deeply:

- Data is not public
- Only authorized users have access
- Sensitive data (like DOBs, contact info) is encrypted
- Backups and access logs will be implemented in production environments

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap (High-Level)

- ✅ Design core architecture (complete)
- ✅ Set up backend/frontend with proper tooling
- ✅ Prepare schema for family data and generations
- 🛠️ Build, test, and launch Release 1 (in progress)
- 🔜 Extend features (events, timelines, inheritance, etc.)
- 🔜 Mobile-first enhancements, offline-first PWA support
